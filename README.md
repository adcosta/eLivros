**Attention:** This is a simple example that I use in HTML5/CSS/JS tutorial

Needs to be contextualized to make any sense... 

Everything is written in Portuguese! (Except maybe this file)

Instalation
===========

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/adcosta/eLivros.git 


Personal Notes
==============

  1. Version 1: Only simple HTML without any styling 

     Uses html elements, like tables, ordered/unordered lists, div, headings,
     etc. Th goal is to show that HTML structures the content but does not give
     any clue on how the browser should present the content to the user. 

  2. Version 2: HTML with some embeded styles in elements -- WRONG practice

     Add style attributes to some elements, directly in HTML source. Not a good
     practice.

  3. Version 3: Moved styles to a separte CSS file and include it in HTML

     The correct way: put every thing related to style in CSS files...
 
  4. Version 4: Add a very basic (and unusefull) javascrit "Hello World" alert

  5. Version 5: Move JavaScript to a separate file and includeit in HTML

     For now only with a simple change color function...

  6. Version 6: Add jQuery to example and make life a litle easier...

  7. Version 7: Add a simple handler to a button...
